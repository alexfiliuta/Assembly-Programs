# Prime Numbers In a Given List in LC-3 Assembly

## Project Overview
This project is an implementation of a prime number checker in LC-3 Assembly language. The program takes two natural numbers as input and determines whether each number in the specified range is a prime number. It then outputs the results in a formatted manner. This project efficiently checks for prime numbers within a given range using basic arithmetic operations.

## Usage Instructions
To run the project:
1. Load the provided assembly code into the LC-3 simulator.
2. Provide the input in the required format.
3. Run the program to see the results printed on the console.
